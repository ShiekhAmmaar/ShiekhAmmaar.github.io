                    Following are a few forms of sports and outdoor games that I love the most:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Athletics</li>

                    <li>Photography:</li>
                    <p>Sice I was a small kid, I always had the knack of clicking pictures of everything that I saw around myself.<br>
                    This was one of the few hobbies that I developed without knowing. I have enjoyed capturing all kinds of<br>
                    moments of my life and I would love to do so in the future. Here are a few pictures that I recently captured:</p>

                        <li><img src="photo1.jpeg" alt="An aesthetic capture of a beautiful view of a lake" width="300" height="400"></li>

                    </ol>
                    <li>Listening to songs:</li>
                    <p>Listening to songs has sorts of now become a habit for me. It helps me in concentration and I usually listen<br>
                       to songs while studying. I love listening to a broad genre of music but here is an audio clip of one of my favourite songs:</p>
                    <audio controls loop src="audio1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>       
                </ul>
                <li>Areas of Interest:</li>
                <p>Two fields of technology, that is Artificial Intelligence and Aerospace have had hooked me up for the many-many<br>
                   hours of the recent days. Aerospcae Industry got to my liking during my time at the elementary school.<br>
                   Everytime an aeroplane flew past the sky, I would gaze and stare at them in awe. Infact, I had immediately fallen<br>
                   in love with the aeroplanes the first time I saw them!!<br>
                   Here is a link to a webpage on Aerospace industry that I have made out of my hert's content!!<br>
                   <a href="aerospace.html">My wonderland of aerospace!!</a><br><br><br><br>
                   Artificial Intelligence is something whic caught my attention recently. During my first semester at Dalhousie University<br>
                   the course ASSC 1800 had a few interesting readings that dealt with Artificial Intelligence which helped me get exposed<br>
                   to this rather amusing and interesting field of Computer Science. Here is a link to the webpage that I created on<br>
                   Artificial Intelligence to showcase it's beauty so that, hopefully, you can fall in love with it aswell!!<br>
